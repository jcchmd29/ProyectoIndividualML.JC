It was fun, pretty buggy, but it was full of promise. Skip forward a few years later. The game is worse. Lets talk about starting the game. The game is slow to start. Starting a game will take just as long, and when you get into the game itself, prepare for unoptimized slowness. The game runs terribly, is riddled with bugs and the devs generally don't add any new content. If this was developed by a good indie team, or an AAA team (Oh, did i forgot to mention they fired several people who worked at Bioware, and hired some scrubs?), it would be amazing.

She has soooo much variety in her playstyle.

The Paris mission is huge and would not have been out of place amongst the latter levels of Blood Money.Improved disguise system. The disguises aren't as ridiculously nerfed as in Absolution, but neither are they as OP as they are in Blood Money. Now only a few particularly perceptive people will be able to see through your disguises if you stay in their line of sight for too long. This brings the focus of the game's stealth back to hiding in plain sight, rather than sneaking in the shadows Choosing loadouts. You can choose your weapons and clothing at the start of missions again, although it seems that they haven't returned to the weapon customisation that was present in Blood Money.Great replayability. There is a large variety of ways in which you can assassinate your targets. Each level is full of unique accidents waiting to happen. There are also a number of challenges on each level that encourage exploration of both the map and methods of assassination. Completing these challenges contributes to the 'mastery rank' of the mission, which allows you to unlock things such as new starting areas and agency stashes on the map.ConsRuns like \u2665\u2665\u2665. The game has some serious performance issues. Expect to turn down graphics quite a bit. Having said that, the game still holds up visually, even on low settings.Always online. It is possible to play offline, but if you are in the middle of an online session and your connection cuts out for whatever reason then you will be pulled out into the main menu and any unsaved progress will be lost. This has happened to me once so far.'Opportunities'. This can be toggled off in the menu (thank god) which I highly recommend you do. This new feature lays out explicitly all the unique ways in which you can eliminate your target. A big bulk of this game comes from exploring the level and scoping out opportunities for yourself, so turning this option off is a must.Episodic. Why fam?This recommendation is based solely on gameplay. A lot of people aren't even able to play the game due to performance issues though so buy it at your own risk.\"}]"},{"user_id":"mashimai","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/mashimai","reviews":"[{'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted April 1.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '218680', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': '- A fun and enjoyable adventure.- Brings out your creativity and stupidity.- But very limited, so it needs some updates.'}]"},{"user_id":"76561198028299001","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198028299001","reviews":"[{'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted October 11, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '218620', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': '\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665in awesome'}]"},{"user_id":"76561198195842698","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198195842698","reviews":"[{'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 10, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '295710', 'helpful': '1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'just pooo'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted March 18.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '440', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'dont get costom hud'}]"},{"user_id":"76561198093361154","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198093361154","reviews":"[{'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted July 25, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '233450', 'helpful': '1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'personally, this game is just to over priced but other than that really good (still quite a few bugs though)'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted July 25, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '20920', 'helpful': '1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'I think that THE WITCHER 2: ASSASSINS OF KINGS is one of the best games out, I personally do not play it because it is to laggy but that just means that the game has AWESOME GRAPHICS. even though you need a good pc to do high, i think it is totally worth it.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted July 25, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '227940', 'helpful': '2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': \"this game is really good. the graphics are average, but i don't mind that, also it is really fun playing with friends and you will have a good laugh- trust me.

I was able to finish Island of Dawn for both my Elin Slayer AND my High Elf Gunner in less than 3 hours wheras before it took me about 5 hours to get off the island with my Castanic Warrior. They also made updated the skill obtaining sector of the game so now, instead of having to see a Tactition or Magic Instructor, you can just get the skill just by cliking on it, and i love that because it SO much time and effort. The game updates are amazing and recomend the game to any MMO fans, though you need a lot of space on your device because the game is HUGE. TERA IS AMAZING!!!!!

The mech in the old game was, underpowered, there should be like rocket launchers and machine guns and a modding station for it, and all this could be powered by some kind of fuel that is hard-ish to make.Recruiting crew members is a pain, needs to be explained a lot more, turns out you have to build a house (or hotel) for people and do missions for them until they go \"welp i love this dude, i want to join his ship\" you should be able to find people in a sticky life or death situation AND then you can gain his trust and friendship (along with the house building)you cant change your worlds, you have one world per game, you should be able to choose a character and then choose a world, not choose a character and get plopped into 1 universe the entier time.Removed the outpost miniquests :(this game is massive and is hard to review in under 10,000 words, but all in all i strongly reccomend this game to people who like terraria and want si-fi jammed down its throat.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted August 13.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited September 3.', 'item_id': '275850', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'I did a review on this game saying that it was great. and now i have to revoke that review and make a new one.

There is a big list of things wrong, and i say, go watch pyrocynicals video on it. I have learnt a lesson here, DONT LISTEN TO THE TRAILER. I cant refund this \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 because i spent 15 hours in 1 day.

Then chances are you wont like this game, but if you liked Minecraft before you turned 12 and the world started shaming you for playing it, then yes this game is for you.2 things when buying a game, 1 read the tags, 2, Read the reviews, if the reviews say its repetitive, and the tags say exploration, then its a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing exploration game.Personally I enjoy playing this game, thats why i spent the entire saturday when the day it came out playing it, its got a nice storyline and goes for everything i love, deep space exploration, Sci-fi, Survival, those are all things that i love but i never saw in the form of a 3D game.)'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted November 6, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '319510', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Scarest Game in YEARS!!!'}]"},{"user_id":"DarkestYT","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/DarkestYT","reviews":"[{'funny': '2 people found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted May 1.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '433340', 'helpful': '1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'So Cute!

However, it sucks you in quickly and, it must be said, sneakily. The tutorials flow seamlessly into the main campaign, from missions where you have just a handful of cards and playing them is so simple you don't even grasp what the challenge could possibly be, and yet soon every missions presents a new and fresh challenge. This may be the best learning curve I have ever encountered, and the tutorialising is very gentle. You encounter more and more challenging units to defeat, and the game encourages out-of-the-box thinking. Beating the game is a healthy challenge, and 100% completion is Herculean, which is how it should be.The story, meanwhile, is absolute nonsense but very enjoyable.

A lot happened to me early in 2014, i watched my parents die right in front of my eyes so of course i retreated to video games.

Fortunately I discovered most people in heroes and generals aren't very good and despite the unfair advantages they have over me, I still manage to score reasonably well sometimes.I have only played as an infantry and am rank 5 or so, so dont take this review too seriously.The vehicles are solid and it's good fun to jump on a machine gun while your mate is driving a jeep into a control point.

I will go ahead now and say I rather enjoy this game quite a bit, it\\'s certainly got enough charm for a quick game every now and then but it doesn\\'t have the lasting draw that most other RE games have. Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City did some things right, but did quite a lot at a mediocre level and some things plain badly, so I\\'ll tell you what i think, and you can decide for yourself.The Good -The Character design: The characters and most enemies in this game are quite varied in appearance and personality, and I like that. Mainly I\\'m talking about Wolf Pack here, they each have an interesting back-story that is never mentioned in-game (you\\'ll need an external source like a wikia for that) and they all look unique and interesting. Personally if they were a little more developed I wouldn\\'t mind seeing them in other games.-The Music: I\\'ll say now regardless of how one-sided my opinion is, I love the music in the game. It\\'s a mix of atmospheric tones to intense dramatic symphonies, all of them fit their respective situations perfectly.The Okay-The Cover mechanics: Cover in this game is a bit iffy, some things you can hide behind others you can\\'t sometimes you can shoot from cover sometimes you can\\'t. It\\'s kinda like rolling the dice with your health and that\\'s never a good thing.-The Combat mechanics: Combat is arguably the main aspect of RE:ORC, and when the main aspect of the game isn\\'t the best part of the game, you\\'re not in for a good time. Recoil feels almost non-existent but bullet spread is a pain to manage, especially with the less accurate weapons. The meele combat is okay, however performing executions and special moves is unresponsive and it usually takes multiple attempts to perform one.The Bad- Enemy design : Enemies in this game can be easily described with the term \"bullet sponge\". They all take a hell of a lot of ammo to kill and that\\'s not helping the face you hardly have any to begin with. This isn\\'t a problem when it comes to the slow and easy to deal with zombies, but when faced with enemy humans, hunters and lickers it becomes a huge problem and is even more apparent in the harder difficulties. Additionally shooting enemies hardly causes them to react, they just take it like nothing has happened most of the time which is frustrating when it comes to already hard to kill enemies like the hunters or the final boss depending on what choice you make.- The Story: Not much to say here, even for a spin off title in an alternate reality the story of this game is really weak and boring with no real development of characters.All in all, RE:ORC is a game that\\'s fun with friends, but not worth the given price-tag. Give it a shot if you can ever get it cheaper but don\\'t expect to be amazed by the game.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted September 24, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '248630', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': \"Kingdoms Rise is without a doubt a game with a lot of potential but one that still needs a bit of work.The gameplay mechanics itself are pretty great, the idea of spells in the game are well done in some ways, and the map design is certainly interesting, encouraging players to learn the maps and think of certain strategies associated with those maps. And for being early in development the character customization is rather good, even if it could be better.However there are some bad things, the animations when it comes to attacks and such are rather boring, and don't have the same amount of 'feeling' in it compared to games like Chivarly (granted, Chivalry did have a bigger dev team and more funds). The lack of music in the game certainly doesn't help, not even a light ambience in the main menu, making the game feel rather dull honestly. Hitboxes feel off, and during online play people with only a 20 ping difference seem to have a large advantage of those with higher ping, making the hitbox issue even worse.Overall, I'd give this game a 6\/10, the idea is great, it just needs to be refined a bit more.\"}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted January 18, 2013.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '21090', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': \"This game will leave you afraid to sleep incase you have nightmares.

Ok yes it\\'s a bit of a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 move to ask your customers to pay for an addon when the game is still in Early Access but i\\'m going to be honest. I Paid $30 for a moderate game that was just starting out. It was interesting but was unable to hold my attention for a long period of time. I took a brake from it. Came back to it last week. There is a huge amount of changes, new dinos, new objects new biomes etc. Theres moving bases now, either via raft or via platform on the back of a dino. This is a huge upgrade to when i initially played ARK. People are complaining about a new DLC, i can\\'t say im happy about paying for the new DLC but, so far i haven\\'t. I may come to buy it in time, but there is more content, unique effects. Different dinos as well as different mechanics in the DLC, not to mention an entire new F\\'ing world. I don\\'t remember them ever saying there was going to be another world at all. Now there are 3? One of which is completely free, one comes with the game and one you have a pay for. The price is a bit high on the DLC but it\\'s not cheap to make an entire world. There is no pay to win, There is no micro transations, how exactly do you think they are going to pay staff to add more content for you to play without paying them?I would also like to state that this game is a modder\\'s Heaven. Not that many games support mods these days sadly. This game does have the development tools required to make some great mods, which i do use. Ok the initial content may run dry after a while. However the community is giving so much content to this game that is all free to enjoy. This is my first modded playthrough and i\\'m having a ball with it. Also worth noting is that the newer maps basically arn\\'t finished yet. There are bugs and issues that some modders have run into, but \"The Island\" the original map is supported fully. TL;DR: Honestly i believe this game is great, the DLC outrage is not warrented, especially as its far from required. almost 100 hours playtime here and never touched the free map let alone the paid one. Great game with one of the best modding communities i\\'ve ever seen.

The game itself is amazing. It's the simcity of your dreams, no really i'm not kidding, this is what simcity should have been. The simulation model works well, the ai adapts to new routes etc easily, and like i imagine happens in the real world people don't just instantly start taking the new roads you build, most of the time it takes a day for the first people to even start using your shiny new roads. It's almost a word of mouth system, where once 1 person uses it they tell people about the new road and it expands from there until its a basic part of the infrastructure. Everyone has their own houses, own work, own school locations etc, people do what people do, they are unpredictable in the most natural way, Traffic congestion is something to consider, but its not the stupid issue that it was in simcity. Sometimes if you plan poorly there will be consequences to your traffic plans, i for instance made a single intersection the hub of my city, while for a long time it was fine, after i placed by 3000th hex of industrial in the industical zone i soon found that my streets were filled with trucks transporting cargo to and from the industry buildings, in mass, like seriously mass there was hundreds, and everyone going in or out of my city had to take a single intersection, this lead to car jams that could span for miles, i even made a mistake on the entrance to my city too, that made the highway backup for miles aswell, this isnt as simple to fix as it may seem. but eventually i believe i have it fixed. but thats the key. IT IS FIXABLE. This is not like simcitys traffic system where once you get to the 10th hour your city is completely screwed. There are buses and trains and even boats! (Which i havent yet built i'll admit) i made a train station for cargo to ease some of the road congestion, however that actually made more traffic issues because everyone was taking a single road. so i made a road with the entire idea of having these trucks on it, they travel above everyone else and go straight to the industrial sectory, this effectively solved part of the issues i had been having, but frankly, like in the real world, there is no quick fix, you cant just build a single road and expect it to fix every problem, yes it will help and yes the ai is smart enough to know this new road is a better option for some of the population to take, but it is not going to instantly fix your problems in most cases.i have one and only one complaint i can level at this game, i have seen some issues with the vehicles running into each other and occasionally clipping through each other, but in most cases one of the vehicles will eventually realise they they are about to, or have hit someone and react as if the other person has right of way and will stop and fix the problem, this is PURELY a visual thing, there is no gameplay reprocussions at all. It is however a negitive to the game so i thought i would mention it. I have no issue at all recommending this game, the price is not even worth mentioning, i wish i'd not bought simcity and this cost twice as much, then i'd be getting my money. P.S. A quick tip, think about your roads, if your fire trucks can't get to a fire, you will loses houses...

There are 3 things this game doesnt have that realm of the mad god has, full screen, permadeath and an oceanic server. Full screen i would like, it would make it a lot more enjoyable experience playing the game in my opinion. though i would like to state that realm of the mad god had weird scaling issues when it went to full screen so i\\'m not completely sure if i can count that as an advantage over this. As for perma-death, it is my most hated system UNLESS you have some kind of progression system in the game that is built upon death. like rogue leagacy\\'s coins gathering mechanic. Realm of the Mad God took this idea and completely murdered it, making you spend real money to get what, in my opinion, should be the progression currency. (for example you need to buy gold coins to unlock more classes)Lastly the oceanic server, this is clearly purely because i live in australia, for most people this wouldnt be an issueBack to this game however, it has more classes, more abilities, it has a pet system which add active and passive abilities to your character. I guess you don\\'t have things like Archer arrows penetrate but in Realm of the mad god but honestly, 4-6x the active abilities makes me not care. I see some people saying about the whole paying model? I mean yes it\\'s there... It\\'s a free to play game, are you new to the concept of in game stores to pay for bonuses? It\\'s a very common free to play model and is, in my opinion, one of the best.

The animation quality is off the charts, i don't believe i've ever seen a game to date with animation quality as good as this has. The animations don't even seem to clip or stutter as you switch between attack moves. I loved the music and sound assets aswell, very suiting to the world. Voice Overs are great quality, suit the characters yet still understandable (In relation to the orc voices).The story, if you are in to lord of the rings and the lore surrounding it you NEED this game. No question, I'm not a lore person, in most games i'll skip cut scenes and i did start on shadow of mordor too, but i don't even know when or how buut somehow i became invested in the storyline and i ended up watching all the cut scenes and the conclusion at the end is amazing, i loved every part of this story and that's not something i say usually.All in all this game is amazing, if i had anything negitive to say about it is that it is somewhat of a short game, steam clocks me at 20 hours at this point, i have completed the story and some of the side missions however, there are many many more.

Amazing game, best i've played in a long time, and i am a hardcore gamer.\"}]"},{"user_id":"76561198095238263","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198095238263","reviews":"[{'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted March 13, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '440', 'helpful': '0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': '\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u7b80\u76f4\u5c31\u662f\u795e\u4f5c\u554a\uff01'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted April 27, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '355840', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': False, 'review': '\u5751\u7239\u554a\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u6839\u672c\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u52a8\u9759\uff0c\u4e8f\u6211\u7b49\u4e86\u597d\u957f\u65f6\u95f4.....\u6d6a\u8d39\u6211\u7684\u611f\u60c5'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted April 6, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '230410', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': '\u8fd9\u771f\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u597d\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u66f4\u6362\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u67aa\u6218\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u505a\u5230\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\uff01'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted February 22, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '730', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'very  good,\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u70b9\u8d5e'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 23, 2013.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '51100', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': '\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u73a9'}]"},{"user_id":"BaaBaaCowSheep","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/BaaBaaCowSheep","reviews":"[{'funny': '2 people found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted August 11, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '202970', 'helpful': '1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'great game with great multiplayer. i normally get 300ping ongames but when i play this i get 60-70. easy to play, hardly any hackers (havent found one yet) maps are set out well. not as much nade spam as described by other people, definetly a run and gun game tho. only one con and thats those quick scoping fgts but that anit the games fault.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted July 4, 2015.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited November 21, 2015.', 'item_id': '22380', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'The base game is great. 10\/10'}]"},{"user_id":"shitmelnbonsays","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/shitmelnbonsays","reviews":"[{'funny': '18 people found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted November 5, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '397430', 'helpful': '28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Legitimately better than Watch Dogs...'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted March 24, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '242050', 'helpful': '0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'I would be more angry about not even being able to start this game if it were not for the fact that I paid for it using csgo items.

DayZ Standalone has been in early access for about 3 years and some people just dont read the note displayed on the DayZ Standalone Steam Page WARNING: THIS GAME IS EARLY ACCESS ALPHA. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAME AND ARE PREPARED TO HANDLE WITH SERIOUS ISSUES AND POSSIBLE INTERRUPTIONS OF GAME. As a short answer I would say dont buy the game until its fully out or in beta unless you want to face countless glitches such as zombies running trough walls and triple hitting. In DayZ Zombies are the least of your worries, you can play as a legendery hero or a bandit. I have been held as hostage 3 times already. You can also play a role playing version of Dayz, I haven\\'t touched DayZRP but you can play it here http:\/\/www.dayzrp.com\/ Pro\\'sRealistic unlike some other zombie-survival games.Really big map that takes alot of your time and does not keep you board.Balanced weapons.Thats really it i cant remember anything else :3 Con\\'s Really hard to meet new people as they might kill you or hold you hostage.Really hard to find ammunition because all millitary bases\/police stations are lootedEverywhere is looted if you play on a server with heaps of people. Conclusion Anyone who says DayZ Standalone is dead, or that the developers have \"taken the money and ran\", or that the community is dead, quite frankly is full of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. The game is very much alive and so much better than it was when it started. Even though DayZ SA has been slow off the start compared to other survivalist games (H1Z1, Rust, ARK, Unturned, Miscreated, etc), I strongly believe it will come out on top as the best survivalist game when it is finished. No other survival game has this much attention to detail and realism as DayZ. No other survival game has the kind of studio resources and money that Bohemia has to put out a strong title. No other survival game has mastered the hardcore aspect of survival and struggle better than DayZ. Almost every other survival game was rushed out on a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Unreal engine in an effort to reap money off the survivalist scene and try to outbeat Bohemia to the punch on features and gameplay. Games like Rust and H1Z1 fail to hit the bullseye on what a survival game should be. DayZ Standalone does this right and does it good. I would definitely recommend this game now, as it\\'s about to surpass the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 outta all other games on the market. Go out there and start surviving! But be warned of the glitches. Thanks for reading!  I also might make a fps boost guide for DayZ!

There are also a few typos here and there (eg the tech trees). It would also be pretty cool if we could still have the 8-Bit Armies music in the game when the original factions are selected.

So far, I've loved this game. There are so many good things I could say about this game, but I'll stick with a few.The Good:-The Research Tree and Units are expansive and diverse. It's great being able to choose specialties and weapons for particular units.-The Music in this game is pretty good. It also fits in with events that are happening. I especially love the epic song that plays when you build the giant mech.-The FPS side is used less often, obviously. However, it is really fun leading your soldiers into battle. The FPS adds to the scale of the game as well as adds attachment to your army.-Infiltrating bases is another thing I love about this game. It makes you look for weak points in the enemy base. It also makes you really think when planning an attack on the enemy base. You can't just run in and gun it out. It's satisfying when a mission goes successfully- but punishing when it doesn't.-Also, I like how this game has character. Once you start playing the FPS side, you'll notice a lot of humour.The Bad:-The AI can be a bit annoying. Sometimes they'll roll into water and die. Other times, they won't guard an area properly. I'd like to see a bit more options for units.-Computer difficulty. The easisest difficulty is not easy. They're hyper-aggressive and relentless. -The Sounds also need a bit of a change.To sum it up, I love this game.

Wasn\\'t as large as I thought it would be, but it was large enough. Of course, we started gathering woods first, so we could have a shelter for the first night. Whereas my friend focused more on the framework, I focused more on making our shelter look pretty, by adding a Japanese-themed roof. Once we placed the last chair, the Guide rushed towards our newly made house and declared it his. Our first night wasn\\'t bad. We just stayed inside, made a second floor while we were fighting off hordes of zombies, and eventually turned it into a temporary shooting range! So for the whole night, we shot zombies with our bows and arrows.The rest of the game was spent doing pretty much that. We collected woods (and sometimes stones), improved on our shelter (which eventually turned into a tower), and eventually mined. We kept mining a specific network, which in time lead us to the Underworld. Now mind you, we played on Hardcore. So if I died, then I die for good on that server. Anywho, our first trip to the Underworld wasn\\'t too bad. We made a hellevator, and rode it down to the Underworld. We scouted for a bit, until we were attacked by demons. When we lost more that 50% of our health, we knew it was time to go back. And so, we teleported back home with our magic mirrors.So from that day forward, our mission was to mine the Hell out of Hell. Now this is where the story ends. I thought for sure that I would have died from a demon, or fell and slipped into lava, but no, it was from something else entirely. I decided to discover more of the network of caves, and hope to find treasure chests here and there. But no. I stepped on a pressure plate, and a boulder fell on me. I died, while my friend laughed and stole my items. That was when I stopped playing Terraria. Then update 1.3 came and I was like, \"Yipeee, I wonder what other deadl y contraptions Redigit has in store for me!\"-pls excuse bad inggris.'}]"},{"user_id":"MrMilitary","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/MrMilitary","reviews":"[{'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 8, 2013.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '239820', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'So Fun!'}]"},{"user_id":"76561197983046427","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/76561197983046427","reviews":"[{'funny': '8 people found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted February 6.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '351090', 'helpful': '7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': \"Magic: The Gathering for the elderly.

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed! Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?\"}]"},{"user_id":"Howaboutsomegoodoldsuicide","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/Howaboutsomegoodoldsuicide","reviews":"[{'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted October 3, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '11230', 'helpful': '2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': \"I have never seen such a byoutfiull maserpiss this game definze viedo games it iw ay bttr then dat scene in call of duty when the enemy nexus kills scout and pyro.It made me feel as if i was 73 years young again i highly recomend it for fans of the call of battlefied black line retroboutions sereis.I es[ecao;;y join the turret sections when the game forces you to open internet explorer and illegali downlaod rul344,My favoruite part is when masterchief opens the vault the and dsicovers it is full of hentaicles.You know now dat i think about it this remidnes me of the trip i took to kush town it was so majessdeticl evceryone weas jappy and smyling and freferferf ,this iswasht i feel when playing Cumign boy ounrament it makes me fe mfeel liek a litt buy and buying ilegal marie jay now if you'd give me aa second i have to un zip my pants ...................................................................................................................................... im kkkkkkk now just had to clear up my seemun However dis is gyme das have sum bad sexample in the underground missions when you have to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ht Jauntraun the game constantly freezex and makes u jave fun ijwicj is bad Over all i give Call of Duty Advanced Warfare a -52\/1\"}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted September 12.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '209060', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Surprisingly the gameplay is actually extremely fun and challenging'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted July 31.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '202970', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': \"At least it's not ghosts\"}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted October 3, 2014.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited April 1.', 'item_id': '209160', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'At least its not Advanced Warfare'}]"},{"user_id":"kruger287","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/kruger287","reviews":"[{'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted August 31, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '212500', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'I grew pipeweed in it.

There is a 50\/50 chance that a world will spawn with either the Corruption or Crimson, changing the boss from a Worm with 50 parts to kill, to a Brain with 20-30 flying eyes which act as body guards that you need to kill before you can even damage their master! All the NPC's have their own look, story, conditions for spawning and items to sell you! One of which tells you what things you can make with the material you give him!

Every person on the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 server with a couple of bucks to spare was calling in an air drop, giving them guns, tools and food, so that they would have a major advantage over the competition. But luckily those days are far behind us, thanks to one of the best alpha development teams I have ever experienced. They listen to what everyone in the community says, most bugs are fixed within a day of them being reported, and the rest they choose to keep working on, full bore, until they are fixed. And I must say, thank god they fixed the air drops. Air drops are now easily able to be seen by whoever is in your corner of the map, the range in which they are dropped is far greater, meaning that as opposed to you buy an air drop and you get it, you are instead having to compete with a barrage of other players for your prize, and finally the drop rate of things like guns and other weapons in an air drop has been dramatically reduced, so that they won\u2019t set you to far ahead of the competition. This has all helped to turn the game into a far more playable and enjoyable alpha.If you want to get an idea of what the game might be like then just picture this, Day Z, but made by a far greater team, with superior skill and coding knowledge, who will in turn choose to listen to what their players ask for and fix every bug that crops up. This game is how Day Z should have been, The forest could have been and rust will never be.I must put this out there, this game is the most fun that I have ever had in an alpha, or even a beta for that matter, and I am putting that down to the wonderful team of devs behind it.The animations, though only in alpha, are beautiful and fluid. There is a smooth transaction between different actions, and a polished look to them, normally only seen in finished games. The graphics, while not that bad, could definitely use some texture updates before the final release of the game as they are currently looking a few years behind schedule, but that is only expected in an alpha, and finally I must just put it out there to all you gaming bullet fans, that this is currently the most polished and enjoyable alpha on the steam market, and thanks to some beautiful optimization, it is playable on most average systems. But never fear, if you are currently strapped for cash but wish you could still play the game it will be free to play to the general public upon final release.One thing that I have currently forgotten to mention is the beautiful design of the games ai. Zombies are as dumb as they should be, and not much of a problem alone, but are attracted to things such as sound, meaning if you fire a gun at the wrong moment you could have a pack of as large as fifty zombies hunting you down at once, which can cause quite a problem. The way they have designed and built this ai really impressed me, they act exactly as you would imagine a zombie should, dumb and only a problem in numbers, and this ai design has carried over to other creatures found in the game world, from skittish deers, to ferocious wolves, ready to attack anything in their sight, and terrifying bears, who once locked onto you are probably some of the most dangerous creatures in the game.The combat in this game has been beautifully designed. The actions are smooth, and you are actually able to feel the power as you send a fist flying into a zombie's head, as they send a hand back, flying towards you. The weapons, while in most cases rare, are very powerful, and will give you a huge advantage over the competition. While items such as combat knives and machetes will give you the upper hand in close quarters combat, a bullet from any of the guns can be absolutely devastating, but remember that a gunshot can be heard miles away, so be careful not to attract the horde, or worse another human hungry for your blood.So have I enjoyed H1Z1? In the two short weeks this game has been out it has come so very far. From the buggy pay to win mess it once was, to the beautifully polished and enjoyable alpha it is today I must say that it is hands down the most enjoyable alpha, or even beta, that I have ever played. It has been twenty dollars well spent, and all thanks to the amazing team of helpful and responsive devs creating it. I would strongly advise any of you zombie or survival fans out there to give this work of art a try, and all that I am left to say is that I can honestly not wait for the next big update, and eventually the final release of the game.

If I enhanced the game, I would of put the price as $10.00, but that's just my opinion though. but believe me it is a great game, it was hailed as one of the best strategy games of it's day. If you're gaming taste is medieval\/RTS it's right down your alley way. It also does have a map editor in the game. Which is great it's better than having to close down the game and open a separate programI would probably have to rate it, 7\/10 Garmes\"}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted August 9, 2014.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited May 26, 2015.', 'item_id': '304930', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': \"I would highly recommend this game to anyone. but it does has flaws but hey, it's still in early access. in order to play with friends you port port forward your router. but there will be dedicated servers 3.0. so that will make things much more easier to play with your friends.

By not being a DLC for BL2 they are able to dump some of the mechanics that didn\u2019t work and get a fresh start without high level characters just blowing through it all.A lot of the haters talk about it being not as long at BL2 as though that\u2019s a bad thing.  I personally felt the main campaign in BL2 was too drawn out and made you do too much running around doing menial tasks to draw the story out.  When people talk about how awesome BL2 was they are looking at Tiny Tinas or Torgues or scarlets DLCs.  Just for reference I had all classes to 72 so I went through that painful storyline a LOT.  I felt TPS kept a better flow going and the missions weren\u2019t stupid stuff meant to delay me.  Having it be its own game let it dump some of mechanics from BL2 such as Slag which caused all of the higher bosses to be balanced around its use and instead replaced it with Cryo which freezes things solid.  The campaign is about the same length or a bit longer than BL1.New weapon type in the Laser, there are a couple of different laser types, the beam type which gradually become harder to hold on target, the railguns which are sorta like a mid range sniper and laser shotguns which aren\u2019t really much different from regular shotguns.  Some of them can be useful but they aren\u2019t earth shattering.The butt slam can be a lot of fun,  I have buddies who will blast through areas just butt slamming everything that moves and giggling like little kids the whole time. As for the classes they bring a different bag of tricks than the BL2 characters.  There is no one character who is completely overpowered like there was in BL2 (I\u2019m looking at you Salvador).There seems to be a bit more attention on characters benefiting each other than there was in BL2.  In BL2 there were only 6 skills that benefited teammates and like three times as many that a group oriented in TPS.Very good game, and I look forward to what they come out with in the future DLCs\"}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted October 23, 2014.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited October 23, 2014.', 'item_id': '238960', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': \"Path of exile is more closely related to Diablo 2 than Diablo 3 is.  You feel powerful and the flexible skill and passives system give you a lot of freedom of choice to build up your character.   I played in the open beta before the Steam launch and probably have an extra 100+ hours in the game than is shown here.Downsides of the passive system is if you make poor or wrong choices in the passive tree you are faced with either rerolling or a LOT of work to undo the damage.  Its also not made clear that you should always be prioritizing defense over offense, things in later acts hit like a mack truck and will easily turn you into paste if you don't build for it.Constant updates means new stuff is always available and the micrtransactions are strictly cosmetic (or in the case of additional bank tabs non-game changing) plus there is always something on sale in the store for half off if you really want something.Highly recomended and the game is completely free anyway so why not give it a shot?\"}]"},{"user_id":"OfficialvnmZz","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/OfficialvnmZz","reviews":"[{'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted November 24, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '730', 'helpful': '2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': '+rep, ez skins ez life'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted August 4, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '252950', 'helpful': '0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'flying is fun'}]"},{"user_id":"ignaciomena22","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/ignaciomena22","reviews":"[{'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted February 13, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '218230', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'malisimo siempre se  queda pegado cuando carga la cuenta y se cierra el juego, me pide que me aga una cuenta pero ya e echo como 3 no lo recomiendo es mucha la molestia que te pide solo para iniciarlo'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted September 29, 2013.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '440', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'exelente juego!!'}]"},{"user_id":"76561198060678051","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198060678051","reviews":"[{'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted July 5, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '202970', 'helpful': '1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'is just the best games of 2013'}]"},{"user_id":"76561198067490430","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198067490430","reviews":"[{'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted January 11.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '32800', 'helpful': '0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'runs smoothly and is your all round awesome hack and slash game!'}]"},{"user_id":"76561198085399133","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198085399133","reviews":"[{'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted August 29, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '304930', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': \"it's the best game what do u think????\"}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted May 13, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '209870', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'ya love this game'}]"},{"user_id":"76561198076474887","user_url":"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198076474887","reviews":"[{'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted April 12.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '368230', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Excelente e cada vez mais bonito.Comprei o jogo pouco tempo depois de seu lan\u00e7amento, e cheguei as minhas primeiras 24 horas jogadas em um piscar de olhos.
